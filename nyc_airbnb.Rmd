knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

## Data import

I'll load the tidyverse and the dataset. I'm also doing a bit of editing and renaming to make my life easier. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

airbnb_data = read_csv("./data/nyc_airbnb.zip") %>%
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group)
```

## Understanding variables

Next I'll do a bit of inspection to make sure I understand the data structure.

```{r}
# View(airbnb_data)
str(airbnb_data)

airbnb_data %>%
  count(boro)

airbnb_data %>%
  count(room_type)
```

## Brainstorming questions

### Does rating vary by neighborhood, room type, or both?

First I'll create a table to look at rating by boro.

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  group_by(boro) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>%
  summarize(median_rating = median(rating),
            mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating))
```

Next I'll try some visual displays.

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, y = rating)) + 
  geom_violin(bw = .1)

airbnb_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = room_type, y = rating)) + 
  geom_violin(bw = .1)
```

Finally, I'm interested in the `room_type` variable. Rating didn't seem to vary much across this variable, but I'd still like to examine this and boro at the same time. 

The chunk below creates a table, and then uses `knitr::kable()` to format the output.

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  group_by(boro, room_type) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>%
  summarize(mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>%
  spread(key = boro, value = mean_rating) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Do hosts with more listings have higher or lower ratings?
First I'll look at the number of properties by each host. This code gave me some trouble in class -- the first try and the better approach are both shown below. 

```{r}
airbnb_data %>% 
  count(calculated_host_listings_count)

airbnb_data %>%
  count(host_id) %>%
  count(n)
```

We'll use `calculated_host_listings_count` moving forward for this question -- that gives the total number of rentals that are hosted by the host in the row. 

I'll try to answer this using a scatterplot

```{r}
airbnb_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = calculated_host_listings_count, y = rating)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

I'll also try to answer this using a numeric summary for a binary `lots_of_houses` variable.

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>%
  mutate(lots_of_houses = (calculated_host_listings_count > 1)) %>% 
  group_by(lots_of_houses) %>% 
  summarize(median_rating = median(rating),
            mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating))
```

If anything, hosts with lots of apartments have slightly lower ratings. 


### Where are rentals located?


### Other questions

There are several questions we didn't get to:

* How is price related to other variables?
* How are descriptions related to number of reviews?
* Which rentals make the most money?
* What's different about low-availability rooms?

Of these, the question dealing with descriptions is one we're not in a position to handle yet -- that involves parsing character strings, which we'll get to shortly. The others we could at least explore using the tools we have at our disposal now.
